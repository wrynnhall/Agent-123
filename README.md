# Agent-123
Small, text-based, terminal decryption game done for my intro to programming class. 

Things to implement:
1. Continue game with the same user. 
2. Create a solve for sentence option, so if the user figures out the letter, they can solve it without manually inputing each character.
3. Use better explaining technique in the display and menu prompts which explain how to play the game.
4. Edit newScreen() formatting
