# Agent-123
Small, text-based, terminal decryption game done for my intro to programming class. 

Things to implement:
1. Better explaination prompts to explain the game better
2. More organized directory structure (make it so txt documents and py documents are in the same directories
3. Add a GUI.
4. Maybe implement some music with pygame??
5. More to come.....
